The goal of **chkptstanr** is to fit Bayesian models in Stan with checkpointing, 
that is, the ability to stop the MCMC sampler at will, and then pick
right back up where the MCMC sampler left off. Custom Stan model can be fitted,
or the popular package brms can be used to generate the Stan code. This 
package is fully compatible with the `R` packages **brms**, **posterior**, 
**cmdstanr**, and **bayesplot**. 

## About this fork

The original package was developed by [Donald R. Williams](https://github.com/donaldRwilliams/chkptstanr). However, the package has not been updated in 2 years, despite breaking issues. Donald has kindly agreed for me to take over the package maintenance and development.


## Installation

The current CRAN version (0.1.1) has several bugs, and until the next release, you can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("venpopov/chkptstanr")
```

These packages are needed.

## Packages
```r
library(chkptstanr)
library(brms)
library(lme4)
```

## How to use chkptstanr

The primary use of **chkptstanr** is to sample from the posterior distribution, while
having the option of starting and stopping the sampler at will. Currently you have two options:

- Manually abort the sampling process at any point
- Predetermine the stopping point by specifying the number of iterations after which to stop the sampler via the `stop_after` argument

### Example 1: Manual abort

To make this clear, we will run the main example from the `brms` (webpage)[https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/#how-to-use-brms]. The only additional arguments here are `path`, the location of the folder in which to store intermediate samples, and `iter_per_chkpt`, the number of iterations between each checkpoint. After the model sampled for 1200 iterations, we _manually_ abort it:

```r
fit1 <- chkpt_brms(count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1|patient),
                   data = epilepsy, 
                   family = poisson(),
                   iter_per_chkpt = 200,
                   path = 'checkpoints/epilepsy')


#> Compiling Stan program...
#> Initial Warmup (Typical Set)
#> Chkpt: 1 / 10; Iteration: 200 / 2000 (warmup)
#> Chkpt: 2 / 10; Iteration: 400 / 2000 (warmup)
#> Chkpt: 3 / 10; Iteration: 600 / 2000 (warmup)
#> Chkpt: 4 / 10; Iteration: 800 / 2000 (warmup)
#> Chkpt: 5 / 10; Iteration: 1000 / 2000 (warmup)
#> Chkpt: 6 / 10; Iteration: 1200 / 2000 (sample)
#> Sampling aborted. You can examine the results or continue sampling by rerunning the same code.
```

If the sampler is passed the warmup stage, it returns a `brmsfit` object, so you can examine the results:

```r
summary(fit1)
```

```
 Family: poisson 
  Links: mu = log 
Formula: count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1 | patient) 
   Data: data (Number of observations: 236) 
  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 200; warmup = 0; thin = 1;
         total post-warmup draws = 800

Multilevel Hyperparameters:

Draws were sampled using sample(hmc). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).
```

We see that the model has not converged, and we can continue sampling by rerunning the same code.

```r
fit1 <- chkpt_brms(count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1|patient),
                   data = epilepsy, 
                   family = poisson(),
                   iter_per_chkpt = 200,
                   path = 'checkpoints/epilepsy')

#> Model executable is up to date!
#> Chkpt: 7 / 10; Iteration: 1400 / 2000 (sample)
#> Chkpt: 8 / 10; Iteration: 1600 / 2000 (sample)
#> Chkpt: 9 / 10; Iteration: 1800 / 2000 (sample)
#> Chkpt: 10 / 10; Iteration: 2000 / 2000 (sample)
#> Checkpointing complete
```

And examine the final results:

```r
summary(fit1)
```

```

```

### Predetermine stopping point

In addition to manually aborting the run, we can predetermine the stopping point by specifying the number of iterations after which to stop the sampler via the `stop_after` argument. 

```r
fit1 <- chkpt_brms(count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1|patient),
                   data = epilepsy, 
                   family = poisson(),
                   iter_per_chkpt = 200,
                   stop_after = 1400,
                   path = 'checkpoints/epilepsy')

```
